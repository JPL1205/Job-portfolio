        <h1>What Get Me Started</h1>
        <p>
            The projects here may seem immature since this is where I began my journey learning web development and design. Back in 2019, I had no prior 
            experience with coding and design, yet I wanted to be part of this vibrant community. So, I started off using Webflow and Figma, designing content 
            that was appealing to me. It felt like I was a 5-year-old kid, intrigued by everything new. I experimented with different design approaches, messed 
            up margins and padding countless times, even to the point of frustration. However, it was a fantastic experience. The projects showcased here mark 
            the beginning of my thrilling journey, and I hope you like them.
